# Webshop with react and firebase

First react app, to try it out and  get familiar with the most basic features.
Using  firebase as a backend, and firestore as a database.

We are selling fortnite skins, currently there's four, but we can add more to the database anytime.

Frontend utilizes bootstrap as well, to make the website look nice.
